YOU'RE HIRED RESUME THEME

Thanks for using the "You're Hired" theme. This is a resume or C.V. template that you can use to display your resume on your WordPress website.

This is a one-page theme. There is no traditional header or navigation menu. WordPress Pages and Posts are still available and they have minimal design and formatting, but this theme was not designed to function as a blog or full website. The intention is to help you create an online resume with WordPress. Please see the documentation for detailed instructions.
